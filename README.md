# Bikesharing
## Overview: 
The purpose of this project is to create Visuals that will reflect: 
 - the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
 - the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
 - the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week
Based on this Analysis  investors will decide if they want to open the similar services in the other city. 

I use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column in given data set from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, I created a Story in Tableau. 

## Results: 

Based of the information reflected in  the first Story, we can see that there were 2, 344, 224 trips made in August. It also  shows the most popular areas for pick up and drop off, as well as the number of users by gender.

The seond  Story shows the checkout times for riders and also provides a break down by gender.

The heatmaps in the third story shows the busiest days/times for the NYC City Bikes. It also  gives a breack down fr this data by Gender.

The last story reflects Trips by Gender and week days and also shows if the user is subscriber or a regular customer.

## Analysys: 

Based on the information, that I was able to visualize in Tableau, I'd say that investors need to take in  concideration the following: 

1. Male use city bikes more freaquently, then female. 
2. The busiest area was Downtown and Midtown Manhattan. The high demend can be due to 
a lot of people who leave in that area, just ride a bike to work. It can also be prompted by a big  number of tourists in that area aspecially in summer time. 
3. The busiest days/times are Monday - Friday at 8-9 AM and 5-6 pm. On the weekend the busiest time shifts to early afternoon time - from  11 am  to 2 pm. 
4. Most of the customesr are using subscription.
